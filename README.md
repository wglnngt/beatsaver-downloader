# Beat Saver Downloader
Now with more Golang:tm:

## What?
This nifty little tool reads your `CustomSongs` directory and downloads all songs off BeatSaver that you don't have already.

## How?
* Download the latest release *(or compile it yourself)* and place it in your `BeatSaber` directory.  
This isn't required, but it creates and reads from a `CustomSongs` folder where it is placed.
* Run the `.exe` and wait. This might take a while depending on your internet speed.

## Why?
Originally this script was written in Python, but that proved too hard for some people. So enter Golang: a compiled language which means all you need is one `.exe` and off you go!

## I don't trust this `.exe`
And I don't blame you. The source is all here on GitHub so if you're sceptical, download Golang and compile it yourself.
